## GitHub Pages Deployment (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `student-kanban-pwa`
3. Make it **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
4. ‚ùå Don't check "Add README"
5. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Click **"uploading an existing file"** link
2. Drag ALL 7 files into the upload box
3. Commit message: "Initial PWA deployment"
4. Click **Commit changes**

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Click **Pages** in left sidebar
3. Under "Source": Select **main** branch
4. Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Step 4: Get Your URL
- Your app will be at: `https://[your-username].github.io/student-kanban-pwa/`
- GitHub will show the URL in the Pages section

### Step 5: Test Installation

2. Look for "üì± Install App" button
3. Click it and install!
4. App appears on your desktop/home screen

## Alternative: Netlify Deployment (Drag & Drop)

2. Drag your entire project folder
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Get instant URL!
5. Bonus: Netlify handles HTTPS automatically

**Pros:**
- Faster than GitHub Pages
- Easier setup
- Free custom domains
- Automatic HTTPS

## Vercel Deployment (Another Option)

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Done!

## Local Testing (Before Deploying)

Want to test the PWA locally?

### Option 1: Python Server
```bash
# In your project folder
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit: http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Node.js Server
```bash
npx serve
# Visit the URL it provides
```

### Option 3: VS Code Live Server
1. Install "Live Server" extension
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Click "Open with Live Server"

**Note:** PWA features work best over HTTPS (GitHub Pages/Netlify provide this)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Install App" button not showing?
- ‚úÖ Are you on HTTPS? (http:// won't work, needs https://)
- ‚úÖ Did you upload both icon files?
- ‚úÖ Is `manifest.json` in the same folder as `index.html`?
- ‚úÖ Try Chrome/Edge (best PWA support)

### Icons not appearing?
- ‚úÖ Check filenames: `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` (lowercase, exact)
- ‚úÖ Files must be in root folder (same as index.html)
- ‚úÖ Clear browser cache and reload

### App not working offline?
- ‚úÖ Visit the site at least once while online
- ‚úÖ Check service worker: F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers
- ‚úÖ Make sure all files uploaded correctly

### 404 Error on GitHub Pages?
- ‚úÖ Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
- ‚úÖ Check Settings ‚Üí Pages for the correct URL
- ‚úÖ Make sure repository is Public
- ‚úÖ Verify `index.html` is in root (not in a subfolder)

## Sharing Your App

Once deployed, share the URL:
```
https://[your-username].github.io/student-kanban-pwa/
```

Anyone can:
- Use it in their browser
- Install it as an app
- Fork it and make their own version
- Use it offline after first visit

---

## Updating Your App

### To add features or fix bugs:

1. **Edit locally**
   - Modify `index.html` or other files
   - Test changes locally

2. **Upload to GitHub**
   - Go to your repo
   - Click on the file you want to update
   - Click pencil icon (Edit)
   - Make changes
   - Commit changes

3. **Wait for deployment**
   - GitHub Pages redeploys automatically
   - Wait 1-2 minutes
   - Clear browser cache and reload

4. **Update service worker**
   - If you made significant changes, update the version in `service-worker.js`:
   ```javascript
   const CACHE_NAME = 'kanban-v2'; // Change v1 to v2
   ```
